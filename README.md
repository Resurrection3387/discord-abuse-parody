# discord-abuse-parody
A simple parody of how you can abuse the Discord API using Node.JS and Discord.JS.
Note:
1. This won't work in any way if you run this on an actual bot.
2. Even if you get this to work, this will 99.99% get your bot (and maybe you) banned of Discord.
3. I am not encouraging you to run this.
4. THIS. IS. A. PARODY. Don't take this seriously. Please.
